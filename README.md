In any organization, there are tasks that would benefit from automation, but often the processes are too niche for standard software. Python is an easy-to-learn programming language that allows organizations to script custom automation and reap the time-savings. In this course, you can learn how to automate your own repetitive tasks using Python. This course provides a “cookbook” for developers and non-developers alike, allowing you to automate almost anything: from filling out PDFs and launching programs, to sending emails and voicemails, working with calendars, and organizing files and folders. Discover how to use Python and open-source libraries and tools such as Beautiful Soup and Selenium to craft elegant solutions that do the grunt work for you.
